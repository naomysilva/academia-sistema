    "name": "Palms-down wrist curl over bench",
    "type": "strength",
    "muscle": "forearms",
    "equipment": "barbell",
    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "instructions": "Start out by placing a barbell on one side of a flat bench. Kneel down on both of your knees so that your body is facing the flat bench. Use your arms to grab the barbell with a pronated grip (palms down) and bring them up so that your forearms are resting against the flat bench. Your wrists should be hanging over the edge. Start out by curling your wrist upwards and exhaling. Slowly lower your wrists back down to the starting position while inhaling. Your forearms should be stationary as your wrist is the only movement needed to perform this exercise. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations:  This exercise can also be performed sitting down by using your thighs as a resting position for your forearms. Your wrist can hang over your knees and the same movements as mentioned above can be performed. You can also use a dumbbell instead of a barbell."

    "equipment": "machine",
    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "instructions": "Load the sled to an appropriate weight. Seat yourself on the machine, planting one foot on the platform in line with your hip. Your free foot can be placed on the ground. Maintain good spinal position with your head and chest up. Supporting the weight, fully extend the knee and unlock the sled. This will be your starting position. Lower the weight by flexing the hip and knee, continuing as far as flexibility allows. Do not allow your lumbar to take the load by moving your pelvis. At the bottom of the motion pause briefly and then return to the starting position by extending the hip and knee. Complete all repetitions for one leg before switching to the other."
